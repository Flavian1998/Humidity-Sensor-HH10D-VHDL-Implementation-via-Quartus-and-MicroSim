# How to run a .vhd code in quartus and compile it ? #
-Launch Quartus II-64bits
-Create a VHDL projet via File → New Project Wizard → Click "Next"
-Create a new file in the project
-Paste the VHDL code you have. If you want to compile the counter for example : paste the cmpt.vhd code and cmpt_TB.vhd code in 2 different files.
-Save the file and the project
-Compile (use the shortcut represented with a play symbol)

# How to realize a Test Bench ? #
-Create the VHDL Test Bench (here compt_TB or I2C_M_Test_Bench)
-Go to Assignement → Settings → General: Make sure that file in
top-level entity correspond with the Test Bench
-Go to Assignement → Settings → EDA Tool Settings → Simulation 
-Compile: Make sure that there aren’t any errors
-Go to Tools → Run Simulation Tools → RTL simulation
-Openning of ModelSim
-Go to Compile and compile all
- Check his own Test Bench and if it runs
-Go to Library Windows → work → our Test Bench → Architecture of
our Test Bench
-Objects Appearance
-Select all the objects and add to a new wave
-Select a simulation time and run

# How to put the .c code on FPGA ? #

- Open Putty 
- Connect the processor of the FPGA (USB port in device manager)
- Upload the executable file (folder of your project) in the command windows using "prompt"
- On putty you can now read the .c code display and see the humidity rate
