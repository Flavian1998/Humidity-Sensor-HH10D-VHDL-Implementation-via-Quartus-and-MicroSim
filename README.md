# Humidity-Sensor-HH10D---VHDL-Implementation-via-Quartus-and-MicroSim
 Implementation via Quartus and MicroSim Private  Updated 3 minutes ago In this project, we will familiar with the I2C bus, Quartus and MicroSim. In this case, we will implement a VHDL code to control a Humidity sensor HH10D
This page is composed in 4 sections : 
- VHDL Code, which takes in account all ".VHD" code used in the project
- C Code, which regroups all ".C" codes that you will need 
- Simulation, regroups Psim and Quartus code to implement
- Documentation, xith all our sources and documents about I2C or Humidity Sensor HH10D
