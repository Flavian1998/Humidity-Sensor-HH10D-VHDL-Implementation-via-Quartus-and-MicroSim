# Humidity-Sensor-HH10D-VHDL-Implementation-via-Quartus-and-ModelSim
Within the framework of the Hardware/Software course, given in Master 1 by Mr. Valaderrama at Faculty Polytechnic of Mons, we have to use a HH10D humidity sensor in order to make it work with a FGPA board following the I2C protocol. 
In this project, we will familiar with the I2C bus, Quartus and ModelSim. 
In this case, we will implement a VHDL code to read datas from the humidity sensor HH10D.
This project is composed in 4 sections : 
- C Code, which regroups all ".C" codes that you will need to understand the sensor 
- VHDL Code, which takes in account all ".VHD" code used in the project 
- Documentation, with all our sources and documents about I2C or Humidity Sensor HH10D. It also contents and in the end, a "TUTO" presentation that explains the code process and regroup all our explanations.

YouTube Videos :

- You will find a presentation video of the HH10D humidity sensor : https://youtu.be/j4jyPf-i3FE
